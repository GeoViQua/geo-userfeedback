INSTALLATION
=================

This installation manual describes how to install the software in a Linux environment.


The following packages are needed to create a feedbackserver instance.
The versions indicated are the versions of the software used tested.

- Python 2.7 (2.6)
- PostgreSQL 8.4
- virtualenv (advised)

optional for production environment:
- gunicorn
- South
- nginx

Create a Postgres database for your feedback items.

$ createdb -U postgres (or username) dbname

Check out the feedbackserver.
Create a virtual environment for the feedbackserver

$ virtualenv feedbackserver_env

Activate the virtual environment

$ source feedbackserver_env/bin/activate

Go the the feedbackserver directory and install all needed packages inside the environment.

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Open /feedback/settings.py

* in settings.py

  - fill in the ADMINS section
  - set the name and path of the database
  - set the template dir (has to be an absolute path) This is the
    installation dir + "/feedback/feedbackserver/templates and contains the 404 and 505 error pages.
  - remove 'south' and 'gunicorn' from the installed apps list, if not used.
  - In the LOGGING section, replace the filename with a complete filepath.

Create the tables in the database

$ python manage.py syncdb

A super user account can be created.
Now run the server:

$ python manage.py runserver

The feedback server is run locally with the development webserver of Django.

=====================================
Start working with the feedback server
=====================================

- via the Django administration tool, users (private user information, username and password)
  can be added and granted access to the server and its functionality
  The topic of user administration and moderation is discussed in the Notes section.

- If the feedback client is used it is needed to create an anonymous user in the database. This relates
  to the public user information, this the information that is part of user quality document (feedback item).
  To accomodate for quick entered feedback such as comments and ratings, in an anonymous way (and low expertise level!), the first entry of the user (UserInformation element)
  in the database is considered to be this user.

- To fill the database use the feedback submission client or post directly XML or JSON via e.g. the command line tool curl:

    curl -H "Content-Type:application/xml" --data-ascii @inputfeedback.xml --user username:pwd http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/feedback/items/

- To view at items in the database

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/feedback/items/search?format=xml

Check Notes.txt for extra information on packages used, possible future changes and integration in existing portals

=====================================
Setup for a production environment
=====================================

An example of how you can deploy the feedbackserver to run in a production environment is explained here.

Download and install the following packages

supervisor - For monitoring and controlling your service. Automatic startup of your server.
Gunicorn   - A Python WSGI HTTP Server
nginx      - A web server, used as reverse proxy, which is relatively simple to configure
south      - optional, can be added for migration when changes are made the data model.

In settings.py
  - set DEBUG = False
  - add gunicorn to the installed apps list
  - add south to the installed apps list

In the templates directory
- customize the 404 and 500 pages

*Quick supervisor help
 create a file feedbackserver.conf in /etc/supervisor/conf.d/
 set [program: ], user, directory, autostart, autorestart, stdout_logfile, sterr_logfile.
 set command to -> location_of_feedbackserver_env/bin/gunicorn_django feedback -b servername:port
